                    1. Introduction<br>
                    <br>
                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.<br>
                    <br>
                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available
                    under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.<br>
                    <br>
                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be
                    updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
                    Test Suite (CTS).<br>
                    <br>
                    1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of
                    business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Accepting this License Agreement<br>
                    <br>
                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You
                    may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License
                    Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use
                    the SDK.<br>
                    <br>
                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you
                    do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or
                    use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. SDK License from Google<br>
                    <br>
                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible
                    implementations of Android.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms
                    (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK.
                    You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
                    non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for
                    that purpose.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and
                    interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that
                    subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under
                    patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other
                    proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the
License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party
licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt,
redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
software license and not the License Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be
incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You
agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any
features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole
discretion, without prior notice to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's
trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive
brand features.<br>
                    <br>
                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
contained within the SDK.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Use of the SDK by You<br>
                    <br>
                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that
you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that
subsist in those applications.<br>
                    <br>
                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions
(including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
United States or other relevant countries).<br>
                    <br>
                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available
to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited
purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.<br>
                    <br>
                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including
the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with,
disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks,
or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to,
Google or any mobile communications carrier.<br>
                    <br>
                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
which Google may suffer) by doing so.<br>
                    <br>
                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such
breach.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Your Developer Credentials<br>
                    <br>
                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
developed under your developer credentials.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Privacy and Information<br>
                    <br>
                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect
certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique
identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and
information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they
are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify
you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
collected.<br>
                    <br>
                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Third Party Applications<br>
                    <br>
                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that
access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that
Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources.
You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through
such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from
which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that
you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
applications, data, content, or resources.<br>
                    <br>
                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their
behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create
derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or
in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the
relevant owners.<br>
                    <br>
                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data,
content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the
relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your
legal relationship with these third parties.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Using Android APIs<br>
                    <br>
                    8.1 Google Data APIs<br>
                    <br>
                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the
data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google
or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their
behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service.
You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the
relevant Terms of Service.<br>
                    <br>
                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge
and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and
only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you
permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented
at the following URL:<br>
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as
updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to
the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which
is located at the following URL:<br>
https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time
to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data
Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Terminating this License Agreement<br>
                    <br>
                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you
or Google as set out below.<br>
                    <br>
                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.<br>
                    <br>
                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:<br>
(A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or<br>
(B) Google is required to do so by law; or<br>
(C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to
you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts
of the SDK to you; or<br>
(D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service,
or the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in
Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.<br>
                    <br>
                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject
to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in
force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by
this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to
such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES<br>
                    <br>
                    10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE
RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE.<br>
                    <br>
                    10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED
THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF
DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.<br>
                    <br>
                    10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br>

AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA,
WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.<br>
                    <br>
                    12. Indemnification<br>
                    <br>
                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or
proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from
(a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates their
rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the
License Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    13. Changes to the License Agreement<br>
                    <br>
                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new
versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version
of the License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made
available.<br>
                    <br>
                    14. General Legal Terms<br>
                    <br>
                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.<br>
                    <br>
                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the
benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal
waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
available to Google.<br>
                    <br>
                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will
be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
valid and enforceable.<br>
                    <br>
                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of
which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License
Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce,
and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on
(or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall
be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND

                    <br>
                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the
other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior
written approval of the other party.<br>
                    <br>
                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara,
California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for
injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
jurisdiction.

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.<br>
                    <br>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
